        <h1>Progressions</h1>
        <p>Chord progressions are what order you play chords in. When playing in a key there are certain chords
             you must play to play the notes of the key only. Each note of the scale can be extended to some specific
              chord while still staying in key. On the chords page I explained the construction of some chords: major,
               minor, diminished, major 7, minor 7, and dominant 7. The below table illustrates which scale tone each
                of these chord types can be played on. </p>

        <p>For example a I V vi IV progression in the key of C could have these chords while staying in key: C G7 Am F

        <p>This chord progression is common and can be found in songs such as Let It Be by the Beatles (which has this

            There is an order in which the chords can be played where when one is played after the other it will give the 
            listener a feeling of tension and release. For example if you play a G7 chord it will sound like it wants to 
            go somewhere. Then if you play a C chord it will sound like it has arrived home. In the major key each chord 
            will have a chord that can be played after it to release it of its tension. You can keep playing through the 
            chords in the order of this chart, releasing tension until you are at the root chord. The root chord is home. 
            There is no tension. <br><br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="chordt">iii<br>></td>

                <td class="chordt">ii or IV<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">V or vii<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">I/Home</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>This is the chart for releasing the tension of chord in a minor key until you arrive home at the root 
            chord:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="chordt">VII<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">III<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">VI<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">ii or iv<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">V or vii<br>></td>
                <td class="chordt">i/Home</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can keep these charts in mind when writing progressions to have your desired effect on the listener. For 
            example you can choose chords to relieve tension, or you can choose chords to create even more. <br><br>

            Some other progressions involve modulations. These are when you change to a different key or change the harmony 
            of the piece. It is common to modulate to help distinguish sections of the piece. For example you may wish to 
            modulate to a different key to distinguish the chorus from the verse. A common key change is to move from a major
             key to itâ€™s equivalent minor or vice versa. For example from D major to B minor. Or another common key change is
              to move to a key that has slightly more sharps or flats to make the piece higher or lower. For example to make 
              the piece sound higher you could move from A to E major to make the piece sound higher. This is because the key 
              of E contains an extra sharp note (D#).<br> </p>
