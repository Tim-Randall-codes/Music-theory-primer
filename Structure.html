        <h1>Structures</h1>
        <p>This is how you arrange the melodies, chord progressions, rhythms and so on into a complete piece of 
            music. Music involves repetition. Too much repetition and the listener gets bored. Not enough and the 
            listener gets lost and cannot understand the piece. Different people have different tastes in repetition. 
            Some may enjoy free jazz, others may prefer something more repetitive. <br><br>
            <b>AB:</b><br>
            One of the most common and simple structures is an AB structure. This could have an A section which contains 
            a melody and a B section that contains a different melody. This is played repeatedly, of course with some 
            variation so the listener does not get too bored.<br><br>
            <b>ABA:</b><br>
            Also called Ternary form, this features an opening section, a different section, then the opening section is 
            repeated.<br><br>
            <b>12 bar blues:</b><br>
            This will have the 12 bar blues chord progression described earlier repeated. It may have a repeated melody over
            it, or the chord progression may repeat with musicians improvising melodies over it. <br><br>
            <b>32 bar song:</b><br>
            This is common in Jazz/American music, such as Broadway musicals. It is 32 bars long, in an AABA structure. 
            There is a main part that plays twice, the second time may have some variation. Then a different section plays.
            The first section then plays again. Songs in this structure are often considered standards that Jazz musicians
            edit and improvise over. <br><br>
            <b>Verse-Chorus:</b><br>
            This is similar to the 32 bar song. However here the B section (called the chorus) is emphasised. In this 
            structure sometimes the
            B section is emphasised to the extent that it is played first (such as the Beatles' She Loves You).<br><br>
            <b>Strophic Form</b><br>
            In this form the A section is repeated over and over with variations. This is sometimes called the AAA form, 
            because it only features one section.<br><br>
            There are also other less common, as well as more complex structures. But it is best to get used to writing in 
            these structures first.<br>
