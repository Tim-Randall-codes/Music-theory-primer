        <h1>Harmony and Chords</h1>
        <p>This part will cover playing different notes at the same time. Harmony is the relationship between 
            different notes. If they sound good together they are in harmony. A group of three or more notes 
            that sound good together is called a chord. Below I explain the basic chords common in music, 
            however there are many different types of chords. <br><br>

            <b>Major chord</b>: The major chord consists of the root note, a major 3rd interval and a perfect fifth 
            interval. The major 3rd interval is four semi tones higher than the root. The perfect fifth is seven 
            semi tones higher than the root. Therefore the C major chord will have the notes C, E, G.<br><br>
            
            <b>Minor chord</b>: The minor chord consists of the root note, a minor 3rd interval and a perfect fifth interval. 
            The minor 3rd interval is three semi tones higher than the root. The perfect fifth is seven semi tones higher 
            than the root. Therefore the C major chord will have the notes C, E flat, G.<br><br>
            
            <b>Diminished chord</b>: The diminished chord consists of the root note, a minor 3rd interval and a diminished 
            fifth interval. The minor 3rd is again three semi tones higher than the root note. The diminished fifth is 
            six semi tones higher than the root. Therefore the C diminished chord has the notes C, E flat and G flat.<br><br>
            
            Another common chord type is <b>power chords</b>. Mostly used in rock, played on distorted electric guitars. These 
            consist of the root note and the fifth only. For example C and G. As these contain only two notes they are not 
            really a chord, but they are common enough that they should be mentioned here. <br><br>
            
            Other chords have four notes. These chords sound richer and are common in jazz. <br><br>
            
            <b>Major seven chord</b>: This is the same as the major chord with a major seventh interval on top (11 semi tones 
            from the root). For example the C major 7 chord has the notes C, E, G, B.<br><br>
            
            <b>Minor seven chord</b>: This is the same as a minor chord, but has a minor seventh interval note added on top.
             The minor seventh is 10 semi tones from the root. For example the C minor 7 chord has the notes: C, E flat, G, 
             B flat. <br><br>
            
            <b>Dominant seven chord</b>: This is the same as a major chord, but it has an extra note at the minor seventh 
            interval from the root on top. For example the C dominant 7 chord is C, E, G, B flat. <br><br>
            
            There are chords that contain even more notes than these, you can keep adding more and more notes. But this level 
            of harmony can wait until after you have mastered these basic chords. </p>
