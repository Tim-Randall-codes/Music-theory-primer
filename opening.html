    <title>Music Theory Primer</title>

    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This website is intended to teach the bare basics of music theory. It teaches just enough to allow you to create 
        music and interact with other musicians. This is good for beginners or experienced musicians, who need to fill 
        some knowledge gaps. I have tried to explain things in a way that does not require standard notation. However I 
        do think that learning to read music can be useful. 

        These are the basic building blocks that artists use to express themselves and convey their experiences. In 
        learning these things I hope you can have fun doing this too. 
        
        Please click the titles across to explore the different areas. These are easier to understand if you read them in 
        the order presented, although this is not essential. </p>
