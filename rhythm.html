    <h1>Rhythm</h1>
    <p>Music is divided into <b>bars</b>. The same parts will repeat often in a piece of music. Commonly the parts that 
        repeat are one bar long (especially the drums). The beginning and ending of bars are indicated in sheet music 
        by a vertical line at regular intervals against the the horizontal lines. It is the horizontal lines that indicate 
        the pitch of the notes. The black box in the two bars tells us that no notes will be played for these two bars. </p>

    <p>The rhythmic identity of a piece is derived from its <b>time signature</b> and <b>tempo</b>. The tempo is how quickly 
        the bars go 
        by.
         The time signature has two numbers. The top number tells you how many beats will be in each bar. The bottom number 
         tells you the note value of the beats. For example this time signature has four beats, and they are quarter notes (4
          means quarter here). So to count these bars you can say: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. This is called 4/4 time 
          and it 
          is common in rock music. </p>

    <p>This example has three beats to each bar and these are quarter notes. It is called 3/4 time, often referred to as a 
        waltz. It is counted 1, 2, 3, 1, 2,3 and so on.</p>

    <p>Rhythm in music works on fractions. Firstly there are <b>whole notes</b>. These will last for the whole of the bar. In 4/4 
        time these are played on the one only. 
    </p>

    <p>Then there are <b>half notes</b>: these will last for half of the bar. In 4/4 time these are counted on the one and three.</p>

    <p>There are <b>quarter notes</b> that last for a quarter of the bar. This can be counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, </p>
    <img src="/Users/timrandall/Projects/mtp/Pics/quarter.png" width="150" height="100" alt="quater note"/>
    <p>There are <b>eighth notes</b>, which last for an eighth of the bar. This can be counted as 1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and.</p>
    <img src="/Users/timrandall/Projects/mtp/Pics/eighth.png" width="200" height="100" alt="eighth note"/>
    <p>There are <b>sixteenth notes</b> that last for a sixteenth of the bar. This can be counted as 1 e and a, 2 e and a, 
        3 e and a, 4 e and a.</p>
    <img src="/Users/timrandall/Projects/mtp/Pics/sixteenth.png" width="350" height="100" alt="sixteenth note"/>
    <p>There are also 32nd notes and 64th notes. But they are so fast that if you are able to play them you are probably 
        already far beyond the ability of a music theory primer. <br><br>
        There are far more advanced rhythms than those outlined here. Once you get used to these you can then move on to 
        some more advanced material. <br></p>
